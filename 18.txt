18. The variable shout is assigned to perform a function that assigns "HEY YOU" to message and then triggers an alert with that message. It is important to note that at this stage, we are simply assigning the variable this function, nothing actually happens. Once the shout(); is executed we see the message displayed for the first time as the code is actually executed. The final alert(message) is unnecessary as the previous message of "HEY YOU" is no longer assigned to message, so the code doesn't have a message to display.
